# CORS Debugging Log

## Current Status
1. ‚úÖ CORS is now working correctly:
   - Preflight OPTIONS requests are successful
   - Proper CORS headers are being returned
   - Frontend can communicate with the API

2. ‚ùå Authentication failing with 401 Unauthorized:
   - Request reaches the backend successfully
   - Server responds with 401 "Invalid email or password"
   - Full request/response cycle is logged
   - Frontend console shows detailed error tracking

## Latest Findings
1. Frontend logs show:
   ```
   Starting login process...
   üöÄ Making API request to: https://api.auroville.social/auth/login
   üì• Response received: {status: 401}
   üî• API request failed: Invalid email or password
   ```

2. Request details:
   ```
   Method: POST
   URL: https://api.auroville.social/auth/login
   Headers: Content-Type: application/json
   Body: {
     "email": "polletkiro@gmail.com",
     "password": "Admin123!"
   }
   ```

3. Backend Status:
   - Admin user created successfully in database
   - Email verification attempted
   - Database connection appears to be working
   - SMTP server configured and working

## Next Steps
1. Database Connection Verification:
   - Add logging to Prisma client initialization
   - Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable in production
   - Check if Prisma can connect to database

2. Authentication Flow Check:
   - Add detailed logging to password comparison
   - Verify JWT_SECRET is properly set
   - Check user record structure in database

3. Testing Steps:
   - Add more detailed error logging in auth route
   - Test database queries directly
   - Verify environment variables

## Infrastructure Status
1. Frontend:
   - React Router warnings present but not affecting auth
   - Login form successfully sending requests
   - Error handling working as expected

2. Backend:
   - Running and receiving requests
   - Authentication middleware responding
   - SMTP server configured and working
   - Need to verify database connection

3. Next Actions:
   - Add detailed logging to auth route
   - Verify database connection string
   - Test database queries directly
   - Check environment variables
