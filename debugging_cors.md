# CORS Debugging Log

## Current Issues
1. Frontend at `https://auroville.social` cannot make requests to `https://api.auroville.social`
2. CORS preflight requests (OPTIONS) are failing
3. Error message: "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource"

## Attempted Solutions
1. Added CORS middleware to Express server:
```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: 'https://auroville.social',
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
  credentials: true
}));
```

2. Nginx configuration already has CORS headers:
```nginx
add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin 'https://auroville.social' always;
add_header Access-Control-Allow-Methods 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS' always;
add_header Access-Control-Allow-Headers 'Content-Type, Authorization' always;
add_header Access-Control-Allow-Credentials 'true' always;
```

## Current Strategy
1. The error persists despite both Express and Nginx CORS configurations. This suggests:
   - The requests might not be reaching the Express server
   - Nginx configuration might be overriding Express CORS headers
   - The preflight request might be failing at the Nginx level

## Next Steps
1. Verify Nginx is properly forwarding requests to the Express backend
2. Check if the auth route ('/auth/login') is properly exposed and not blocked
3. Review Docker networking setup to ensure proper communication between services
4. Add request logging to track the full request path
5. Consider consolidating CORS handling to either Nginx or Express, not both

## Questions to Answer
1. Are requests reaching Nginx? (Based on error, yes)
2. Are requests being forwarded to Express backend? (Need to verify)
3. Is the Docker network properly configured?
4. Which layer should handle CORS - Nginx or Express?
