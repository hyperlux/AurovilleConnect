# CORS Debugging Log

## Current Status
1. ‚úÖ CORS is now working correctly:
   - Preflight OPTIONS requests are successful
   - Proper CORS headers are being returned
   - Frontend can communicate with the API

2. ‚ùå Authentication failing with 401 Unauthorized:
   - Request reaches the backend successfully
   - Server responds with 401 "Invalid email or password"
   - Full request/response cycle is logged

## Latest Findings
1. Backend logs show:
   ```
   üîç Incoming Request:
   - email: 'polletkiro@gmail.com'
   - password: 'Admin123!'
   Response: 401 Unauthorized
   ```

2. CORS Configuration Working:
   ```
   access-control-allow-origin: https://auroville.social
   access-control-allow-credentials: true
   access-control-allow-methods: GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS
   access-control-allow-headers: Content-Type,Authorization
   ```

## Next Steps
1. Investigate authentication failure:
   - Verify user exists in database
   - Check password hashing/comparison
   - Review authentication logic in `/auth/login` route
   - Check database connection and configuration

2. Add more detailed error logging:
   - Log specific authentication failure reasons
   - Add database query logging
   - Monitor password comparison results

## Infrastructure Status
1. Nginx (Frontend):
   - Running and properly configured
   - Successfully proxying requests
   - SSL/TLS working correctly

2. Express (Backend):
   - Running on port 5000
   - CORS middleware configured correctly
   - Request logging working
   - Email service connected

3. Database:
   - Connection established
   - Need to verify user records
