# CORS Debugging Log

## Current Status
1. ‚úÖ CORS is now working correctly:
   - Preflight OPTIONS requests are successful
   - Proper CORS headers are being returned
   - Frontend can communicate with the API

2. ‚ùå Authentication failing with 401 Unauthorized:
   - Request reaches the backend successfully
   - Server responds with 401 "Invalid email or password"
   - Full request/response cycle is logged
   - Frontend console shows detailed error tracking

## Latest Findings
1. Frontend logs show:
   ```
   Starting login process...
   üöÄ Making API request to: https://api.auroville.social/auth/login
   üì• Response received: {status: 401}
   üî• API request failed: Invalid email or password
   ```

2. Request details:
   ```
   Method: POST
   URL: https://api.auroville.social/auth/login
   Headers: Content-Type: application/json
   Body: {
     "email": "polletkiro@gmail.com",
     "password": "Admin123!"
   }
   ```

3. CORS Configuration Working:
   ```
   access-control-allow-origin: https://auroville.social
   access-control-allow-credentials: true
   access-control-allow-methods: GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS
   access-control-allow-headers: Content-Type,Authorization
   ```

## Next Steps
1. Database Verification:
   - Connect to production database and verify user exists
   - Check if email "polletkiro@gmail.com" is present
   - Verify password hash matches

2. Backend Investigation:
   - Add detailed logging in auth middleware
   - Log password comparison results
   - Check if user is found in database before password check

3. Testing Steps:
   - Try creating a new admin user using simple-admin.js script
   - Test login with newly created credentials
   - Verify database connection string in production

## Infrastructure Status
1. Frontend:
   - React Router warnings present but not affecting auth
   - Login form successfully sending requests
   - Error handling working as expected

2. Backend:
   - Running and receiving requests
   - Authentication middleware responding
   - Need to verify database connection

3. Next Actions:
   - Run simple-admin.js to create test admin
   - Add more detailed logging in auth route
   - Check production database credentials
