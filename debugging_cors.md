# CORS Debugging Log

## Current Status
1. ✅ CORS is working correctly for auth endpoints:
   - Preflight OPTIONS requests are successful
   - Proper CORS headers are being returned
   - Frontend can communicate with the API

2. ✅ Authentication now working:
   - Login successful
   - JWT tokens being generated correctly
   - User session maintained

3. ❌ New CORS issue with notifications endpoint:
   - Preflight request failing for https://api.auroville.social/api/notifications
   - Error: "Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check"
   - Endpoint not returning HTTP ok status for OPTIONS request

## Latest Findings
1. Frontend successfully authenticating:
   - Login working correctly
   - Protected routes rendering properly
   - Auth state being maintained

2. Notifications endpoint issues:
   ```
   Access to fetch at 'https://api.auroville.social/api/notifications' 
   from origin 'https://auroville.social' has been blocked by CORS policy
   ```

## Next Steps
1. Notifications API Fix:
   - Add CORS handling for notifications endpoint
   - Ensure OPTIONS requests are handled correctly
   - Verify CORS headers for /api/notifications route

2. Infrastructure Status:
   - Frontend: Working with authenticated routes
   - Backend: Auth working, needs CORS fix for notifications
   - Database: Connection verified and working

3. Next Actions:
   - Add CORS handling for notifications endpoint
