### Forum API Endpoint Issue (Fixed)
1. Issue: Forum page getting 404 error when fetching posts
   - Error: GET http://localhost:5000/forums? 404 (Not Found)
   - Frontend was calling incorrect endpoint

2. Root Cause Analysis:
   - Backend routes are mounted with `/api` prefix in index.js
   - Frontend was not including `/api` prefix in API calls
   - Backend expects `/api/forums/posts` but frontend was calling `/forums`

3. Solution:
   - Updated Forums.tsx to use correct endpoint path
   - Changed API call to include `/api` prefix
   - Updated endpoint to match backend route structure

4. Changes Made:
   ```tsx
   // Before
   const response = await api.get(`/forums?${params.toString()}`);

   // After
   const response = await api.get(`/api/forums/posts?${params.toString()}`);
   ```

5. Results:
   - Forum posts now load correctly
   - API requests properly reach the backend
   - Maintained all existing functionality
