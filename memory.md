   - App manifest for installation
   - Cache strategies for assets
   - Push notification groundwork

2. Responsive Enhancements:
   - Mobile navigation menu
   - Adaptive search bar
   - Responsive visitor counter
   - Touch-optimized carousel

3. Infrastructure Updates:
   - NGINX configuration for PWA
   - SSL/HTTPS setup
   - Docker optimization
   - Build process improvements

## Current Issues
1. ðŸ”§ Build Process:
   - URI malformed error in production build
   - PWA asset path resolution
   - Docker build optimization needed

2. ðŸ”§ Performance:
   - Initial load time optimization needed
   - Image optimization required
   - Cache strategy refinement

## Next Steps
1. Immediate Priorities:
   - Fix build process issues
   - Implement image optimization
   - Add file type validation
   - Setup proper error boundaries

2. Feature Pipeline:
   - Push notifications system
   - Image cropping/compression
   - Offline data sync
   - Real-time updates

3. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement lazy loading
   - Add code splitting
   - Optimize bundle size
   - Cache strategy refinement

## Development Workflow
1. Local Development:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Production Deployment:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   docker-compose down
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

3. SSL Certificate Renewal:
   - Automated through Let's Encrypt
   - Monitor expiration dates
   - Backup certificates

## Notes
- Keep monitoring server resources
- Regular database backups
- Check SSL certificate expiration
- Update dependencies monthly
- Monitor error logs daily
- Test PWA installation regularly
- Check offline functionality
- Monitor API response times
