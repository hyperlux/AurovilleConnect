### Forum Posts Fetch Error (Fixed)
1. Issue: 500 Internal Server Error when fetching forum posts
   - Error: Unknown field `views` for select statement on model `ForumPostCountOutputType`
   - Backend was trying to count 'views' as a relation

2. Root Cause Analysis:
   - 'views' is a regular Int field in ForumPost model, not a relation
   - Prisma _count select can only count relations (like comments)
   - Attempting to count 'views' in _count select caused validation error

3. Solution:
   - Removed 'views' from _count select statement
   - Access 'views' directly from post object in formattedPosts mapping
   - Added more detailed error logging for troubleshooting

4. Changes Made:
   ```js
   // Before
   _count: {
     select: {
       comments: true,
       views: true  // This was incorrect
     }
   }

   // After
   _count: {
     select: {
       comments: true  // Only count actual relations
     }
   }

   // Access views directly in formatting
   views: post.views
   ```

5. Results:
   - Forum posts now load correctly
   - View counts displayed properly
   - Maintained all existing functionality

## Layout and API Endpoint Fixes (December 13, 2024)

### Issues Fixed
1. Wide spacing between sidebar and main content
2. Forum posts not fetching in production
3. Inconsistent API endpoint structure between development and production

### Solutions Implemented

1. Layout Spacing Fix:
   ```jsx
   // Before (Layout.tsx)
   <main className="flex-1 bg-[#1e1e1e] pl-2 pr-6 py-6">

   // After
   <main className="flex-1 bg-[#1e1e1e] px-4 py-6">
   ```

2. API Endpoint Structure:
   ```typescript
   // api.ts - Consistent baseURL configuration
   const baseURL = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
     ? '/api'  // Production
     : 'http://localhost:5000/api';  // Development

   // Forums.tsx - Consistent endpoint usage
   const response = await api.get(`/forums/posts?${params.toString()}`);

   // CreatePostModal.tsx - Fixed post endpoint
   const response = await api.post('/forums/posts', data);
   ```

3. Results:
   - Consistent spacing between sidebar and main content
   - Forum posts fetch correctly in both development and production
   - API endpoints work consistently across environments
   - Smooth workflow between local development and production server
