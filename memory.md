### Forum Posts Fetch Error (Fixed)
1. Issue: 500 Internal Server Error when fetching forum posts
   - Error: Unknown field `views` for select statement on model `ForumPostCountOutputType`
   - Backend was trying to count 'views' as a relation

2. Root Cause Analysis:
   - 'views' is a regular Int field in ForumPost model, not a relation
   - Prisma _count select can only count relations (like comments)
   - Attempting to count 'views' in _count select caused validation error

3. Solution:
   - Removed 'views' from _count select statement
   - Access 'views' directly from post object in formattedPosts mapping
   - Added more detailed error logging for troubleshooting

4. Changes Made:
   ```js
   // Before
   _count: {
     select: {
       comments: true,
       views: true  // This was incorrect
     }
   }

   // After
   _count: {
     select: {
       comments: true  // Only count actual relations
     }
   }

   // Access views directly in formatting
   views: post.views
   ```

5. Results:
   - Forum posts now load correctly
   - View counts displayed properly
   - Maintained all existing functionality
