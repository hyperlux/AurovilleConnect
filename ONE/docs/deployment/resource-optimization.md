# Resource Optimization and Monitoring Strategy

This document outlines the resource optimization strategies implemented to improve the performance and stability of the Auroville Connect application. It also details the monitoring strategy to ensure the application runs smoothly.

## Docker Container Optimizations

- **Resource Limits:** CPU and memory limits have been set for each container in `docker-compose.yml` to prevent any single container from consuming excessive resources.
  - `db` container: CPU limit of 0.50, memory limit of 512MB, CPU reservation of 0.25, memory reservation of 256MB.
  - `app` container: CPU limit of 0.70, memory limit of 512MB, CPU reservation of 0.35, memory reservation of 256MB.
  - `nginx` container: CPU limit of 0.50, memory limit of 512MB, CPU reservation of 0.25, memory reservation of 256MB.
- **Alpine-based Images:** The `nginx` container uses the `nginx:alpine` image, which is a lightweight base image, reducing the overall size and resource footprint.

## PM2 Optimizations

- **Clustering:** PM2 is configured to run the Node.js application in cluster mode, utilizing all available CPU cores for better performance.
- **Memory Limits:** The `max_memory_restart` option is set to 512MB, ensuring that PM2 restarts the application if it exceeds this limit, preventing memory leaks from causing crashes.
- **Garbage Collection:** The `--gc-interval=50` flag is used to trigger garbage collection more frequently, improving memory management.

## Nginx Optimizations

- **Worker Processes:** The number of worker processes is set to 4, which is suitable for most server configurations.
- **Worker Connections:** The number of worker connections is set to 2048, allowing Nginx to handle a large number of concurrent connections.
- **Caching:** Nginx is configured to cache static files and proxy responses, reducing the load on the application server.
- **Buffer Sizes:** Buffer sizes are optimized to handle large client requests and responses efficiently.
- **Gzip Compression:** Gzip compression is enabled to reduce the size of responses, improving page load times.

## Monitoring Strategy

- **Docker Stats:** The `docker stats` command is used to monitor the resource usage of each container in real-time.
- **Custom Monitoring Script:** A custom script `monitor-resources.sh` is used to track resource usage over time and log the metrics.

## Build Process Optimizations

- **Multi-stage Builds:** The Dockerfile uses multi-stage builds to reduce the final image size.
- **Optimized npm install:** The `npm ci` command is used for faster and more reliable builds.
- **.dockerignore:** A `.dockerignore` file is used to exclude unnecessary files from the Docker build context.

## Deployment Strategy

- **Staged Deployment:** The `deploy.sh` script implements a staged deployment process, ensuring that the application is deployed smoothly.
- **Health Checks:** The `deploy.sh` script includes health checks to verify that the application is running correctly after deployment.
- **Rollback Capability:** The `deploy.sh` script includes a rollback capability to revert to the previous version if the deployment fails.

This document will be updated as new optimizations and monitoring strategies are implemented.
