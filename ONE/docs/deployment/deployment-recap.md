# Deployment Recap and Action Plan

## Current Status

The application is now live at auroville.social with the following components in place:

- Frontend application served via Nginx
- Backend API server running with PM2
- PostgreSQL database
- SSL certificates
- Service worker and PWA functionality
- Automated maintenance scripts

## Deployment Scripts

We have created several maintenance scripts to automate common tasks:

### 1. deploy.sh
- Handles the complete deployment process
- Builds the application
- Updates Docker containers
- Verifies deployment success

### 2. renew-certs.sh
- Automates SSL certificate renewal
- Restarts Nginx after renewal
- Logs renewal process
- Should be run via cron job

### 3. monitor.sh
- Monitors application health
- Checks container status
- Verifies API endpoints
- Monitors resource usage

### 4. backup.sh
- Creates timestamped backups
- Backs up database, uploads, and configurations
- Maintains backup retention policy
- Verifies backup integrity

## Action Plan

### 1. Regular Maintenance
- Run backups daily using cron:
```bash
0 1 * * * /root/AurovilleConnect/backup.sh
```
- Monitor SSL certificate expiration:
```bash
0 0 * * 0 /root/AurovilleConnect/renew-certs.sh
```
- Check application health hourly:
```bash
0 * * * * /root/AurovilleConnect/monitor.sh
```

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Monitor and optimize database queries
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Optimize static asset delivery
- Monitor and adjust container resources

### 3. Security Measures
- Regular security audits
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor access logs
- Implement rate limiting
- Regular password rotation for admin accounts

### 4. Scaling Considerations
- Monitor resource usage trends
- Plan for horizontal scaling if needed
- Optimize database indexes
- Consider implementing load balancing

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. SSL Certificate Issues
   - Check certificate expiration
   - Verify Nginx configuration
   - Run renew-certs.sh manually
   - Check certificate permissions

2. Database Connection Issues
   - Verify PostgreSQL container status
   - Check connection strings
   - Monitor database logs
   - Verify network connectivity

3. Application Performance
   - Check container resource usage
   - Monitor API response times
   - Review application logs
   - Check for memory leaks

4. Static Asset Delivery
   - Verify Nginx caching
   - Check MIME types
   - Monitor CDN performance
   - Optimize asset sizes

### Emergency Procedures

1. Site Down
```bash
# Quick restart of all services
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

2. Database Issues
```bash
# Restore from latest backup
./backup.sh restore latest
```

3. SSL Emergency
```bash
# Force certificate renewal
./renew-certs.sh --force
```
