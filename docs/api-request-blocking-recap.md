# API Request Blocking and Service Worker Resolution

## Issues Addressed
1. API requests being blocked with ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT
2. Service Worker 404 errors
3. localhost:5000 being used instead of production API URL

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment and Build Process
- Ensured VITE_API_URL is set to production URL in .env
- Updated build process to use production environment variables
- Cleaned and reinstalled dependencies for both frontend and backend

### 2. Deployment Script Updates
- Modified restart-servers.sh to properly copy built files to nginx directory
- Added proper permissions setting for service worker file
- Ensured service worker is copied to the correct location
- Added error checking for file copying process

### 3. Service Worker Configuration
- Updated nginx configuration for proper service worker handling
- Added specific location block for service-worker.js
- Set correct CORS and caching headers
- Added logging for service worker requests
- Fixed service worker path resolution by ensuring proper base URL configuration
- Updated service worker registration to use correct absolute path

### 4. Server Configuration
- Restarted all services (PM2, nginx)
- Verified API health checks
- Ensured proper environment variable propagation

## Current State
- Frontend successfully deployed to production
- Service worker properly registered
- API requests working correctly
- All services running under PM2

## Verification Steps
1. Frontend build successful
2. Files correctly copied to nginx directory
3. Service worker registration successful with correct URL
4. API responding correctly
5. PM2 processes running properly
6. Service worker accessible at correct absolute path
