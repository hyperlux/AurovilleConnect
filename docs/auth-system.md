# Authentication System Documentation

## Current Architecture
The authentication system is built using:
- Express.js for routing
- Prisma for database interactions
- Zod for input validation
- bcryptjs for password hashing
- jsonwebtoken for JWT tokens
- Winston for logging
- CORS for cross-origin requests
- Email verification system

## Implemented Changes
1. **CORS Configuration**
   - Added CORS middleware with specific origin
   - Configured allowed methods and headers
   - Added preflight request handling

2. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Implemented Winston logger
   - Added detailed logging for auth events
   - Created separate error and combined logs

3. **Security Improvements**
   - Added rate limiting to auth endpoints
   - Implemented proper CORS headers
   - Added input validation for all endpoints

4. **Email Verification**
   - Added verification token generation
   - Implemented email sending
   - Added resend verification capability
   - Added token validation

5. **Password Reset**
   - Added reset token generation
   - Implemented token validation
   - Added password update functionality

## Key Features
1. **Login Flow**
   - Input validation with Zod
   - User lookup with Prisma
   - Password verification with bcrypt
   - JWT token generation
   - Email verification check
   - Detailed logging

2. **Registration Flow**
   - Input validation
   - Email uniqueness check
   - Password hashing
   - Verification token generation
   - Email sending
   - Auto-verification in development

3. **Password Reset**
   - Reset token generation
   - Token validation
   - Password update
   - Token expiry handling

4. **Email Verification**
   - Verification token generation
   - Email sending
   - Token validation
   - Resend capability
   - Auto-verification status check

5. **Token Verification**
   - Middleware-based authentication
   - User data retrieval
   - Role-based access control

## Known Issues
1. **CORS Configuration**
   - Current origin is hardcoded
   - Consider making it configurable

2. **Error Handling**
   - Some error responses could be more detailed
   - Consider adding error codes

3. **Security**
   - JWT secret should be rotated periodically
   - Consider adding IP-based rate limiting

4. **Logging**
   - Audit logs could be more detailed
   - Consider adding user agent logging

## Future Steps
1. Implement configurable CORS origins
2. Add more detailed error responses
3. Implement JWT secret rotation
4. Add IP-based rate limiting
5. Enhance audit logging
6. Add 2FA support
7. Implement session management
8. Add password complexity requirements
9. Implement account lockout after failed attempts
10. Add security headers middleware
